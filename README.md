Aracna Hardware
=====================


This repository contains the files necessary to print the [Aracna](http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/aracna) robot. For drivers, see the [aracna branch](https://github.com/yosinski/QuadraTot/tree/aracna) of the QuadraTot repository.

Version 1 (old)
--------------------

Version 1 of Aranca was a test design and is not recommended for production use. Instead, see Version 2.1 below. For design files, see the [aracnaV1](https://github.com/yosinski/aracnaHardware/tree/master/aracnaV1) directory.

Version 2.1 (current)
--------------------

Version 2.1 can be used with the RaspberryPi. The top case is wider and access holes were added in the sides for external connections. All other components are identical to version 2.0.
For design files, see the [aracnaV2](https://github.com/yosinski/aracnaHardware/tree/master/aracnaV2) directory.

Updated top case with new lid.
